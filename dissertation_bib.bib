abstract = {Corrosion resistance is an important property requirement for marine paint systems used in naval industry such as for ship's topsides and superstructures, which obliges testing the coating performance in order to make a durable selection of the paint systems. This can be achieved by performing laboratory accelerated corrosion tests recommended for C5M corrosivity class (in particular the standard neutral salt spray test ISO 9227 or the cyclic corrosion test ISO 20340-Annex A) which give results in a rather short delay (up to 6 months) compared to field exposures in marine atmospheres (several years). It is however well known that these tests may not be fully representative of real ship environmental conditions. The aims of the present study were thus to compare and estimate the correlation of various accelerated corrosion tests including standardized tests (ISO 9227, ISO 20340, ISO 16701) and newly developed test conditions to field exposures on worldwide operating ships (container carrier vessel and oceanographic ship) and on conventional static marine atmospheric sites (C5M). Fifteen different marine paint systems commonly used for offshore and naval application were selected for the study. From the results, the exposure conditions on the container vessel were the most aggressive ones compared to static exposures after 2 years. The best correlation to such field exposure was observed using the cyclic test ISO 16701 with a deviation inferior to 25%, an acceleration factor of 4 and comparable corrosion aspect. If all testing conditions involving NaCl 5wt% (including ISO 20340) showed a superior acceleration factor (e.g., about 12), a larger deviation (50%) was however found indicating that these tests did not accelerate the corrosion degradation of the paint systems similarly to field exposures. In addition, conditions for an optimization of ISO 20340 annex A test were found.},

Both general parameters devised by fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models and more regional parameters are defined. The overall process of atmospheric corrosion is broken into its constituent processes which, for an island such as Australia, consist of aerosol generation, aerosol transport, aerosol deposition, pollutant retention on surfaces, wetting of polluted surfaces, and the chemistry of moisture films on surfaces. The possible effects of climate change on each of these processes are analysed and discussed, and initial results indicating that each may be affected by climate change. However, as variation in the constituent processes is heavily dependent on parameters that vary significantly across Australia, and the effect of the variations differs for different processes, it is difficult to make a general prediction of the average impact of climate change on corrosion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

abstract = {Spatial climate data are often key drivers of computer models and statistical analyses, which form the basis for scientific conclusions, management decisions, and other important outcomes. The recent availability of very high-resolution climate data sets raises important questions about the tendency to equate resolution with realism. This paper discusses the relationship between scale and spatial climate-forcing factors, and provides background and advice on assessing the suitability of data sets. Spatial climate patterns are most affected by terrain and water bodies, primarily through the direct effects of elevation, terrain-induced climate transitions, cold air drainage and inversions, and coastal effects. The importance of these factors is generally lowest at scales of 100 km and greater, and becomes greatest at less than 10 km. Except in densely populated regions of developed countries, typical station spacing is on the order of 100 km. Regions without major terrain features and which are at least 100 km from climatically important coastlines can be handled adequately by most interpolation techniques. Situations characterized by significant terrain features, but with no climatically important coastlines, no rain shadows, and a well-mixed atmosphere can be reasonably handled by methods that explicitly account for elevation effects. Regions having significant terrain features, and also significant coastal effects, rain shadows, or cold air drainage and inversions are best handled by sophisticated systems that are configured and evaluated by experienced climatologists. There is no one satisfactory method for quantitatively estimating errors in spatial climate data sets, because the field that is being estimated is unknown between data points. Perhaps the best overall way to assess errors is to use a combination of approaches, involve data that are as independent from those used in the analysis as possible, and use common sense in the interpretation of results. Data set developers are encouraged to conduct expert reviews of their draft data sets, which is probably the single most effective way to improve data set quality.

abstract = {Classifying the land surface into climate types provides means of diagnosing relations between Earth's physical and biological systems and the climate. Global climate classifications are also used to visualize climate change. Clustering climate datasets provides a natural approach to climate classification, but the rule-based K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger classification (KGC) is the one most widely used. Here, a comprehensive approach to the clustering-based classification of climates is presented. Local climate is defined as a multivariate time series of mean monthly climatic variables and the authors propose to use dynamic time warping (DTW) as a measure of dissimilarity between local climates. Also discussed are the choice of climatic variables, the importance of their proper normalization, and the advantage of using distance-based clustering algorithms. Using the WorldClim global climate dataset and different combinations of clustering parameters, 32 different clustering-based classifications are calculated. These classifications are compared between themselves and to the KGC using the information-theoretic V measure. It is found that the best classifications are obtained using three climate variables (temperature, precipitation, and temperature range), a data normalization that takes into account the skewed distribution of precipitation values, and the partitioning around medoids clustering algorithm. Two such classifications are compared in detail between each other and to the KGC. About half of the climate types found by clustering can be matched to the familiar KGC classes, but the rest differ in their climatic character and spatial distribution. Finally, it is demonstrated that clustering-based classification results in climate types that are internally more homogeneous and externally more distinct than climate types in the KGC.},

A preliminary aspect of such design endeavors is the acquisition of accurate knowledge regarding the climatic conditions in each region of the studied territory. The objective of this paper is to propose a climatic zoning for Madagascar from a database of 47 meteorological stations by performing hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC). The results are then combined with spatial interpolation using geographic information system (GIS) tools, enabling us to define three climate zones corresponding to dry, humid and highland areas. These results make it possible to define standard meteorological files to evaluate the thermal performance of traditional Malagasy houses. Regardless of the type of house and the areas considered, the percentage of thermal comfort according to the Givoni bioclimatic chart varies from average values of 20% without ventilation to 70% with an air velocity of 1 m/s. In summary, Madagascar's traditional habitat typologies have adapted over time to the constraints of their environment.},

These should be clustered in order to detect common patterns regarding temperatures curves and help to choose representative scenarios for network simulations, which in turn can be used for energy optimisation. We first show that the choice of the distance used for the clustering has a strong impact on the meaning of the results: depending on the type of distance used, either spatial or temporal patterns prevail. Then we discuss the difficulty of fine-tuning the distance choice (combined with a dimension reduction procedure) and we propose a methodology based on a carefully designed index.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can potentially provide powerful tools for classifying and identifying patterns in climate and environmental data. However, because of the inherent complexities of such data, which are often spatio-temporal, chaotic, and non-stationary, the CNN algorithms must be designed/evaluated for each specific dataset and application. Yet to start, CNN, a supervised technique, requires a large labeled dataset. Labeling demands (human) expert time, which combined with the limited number of relevant examples in this area, can discourage using CNNs for new problems. To address these challenges, here we 1) Propose an effective auto-labeling strategy based on using an unsupervised clustering algorithm and evaluating the performance of CNNs in re-identifying these clusters; 2) Use this approach to label thousands of daily large-scale weather patterns over North America in the outputs of a fully-coupled climate model and show the capabilities of CNNs in re-identifying the 4 clustered regimes. The deep CNN trained with 1000 samples or more per cluster has an accuracy of 90% or better. Accuracy scales monotonically but nonlinearly with the size of the training set, e.g. reaching 94% with 3000 training samples per cluster. Effects of architecture and hyperparameters on the performance of CNNs are examined and discussed.},

abstract = {Existing climate classification has not been designed for an efficient handling of public health scenarios. This work aims to design an objective spatial climate regionalization method for assessing health risks in response to extreme weather. Specific climate regions for the conterminous United States of America (USA) were defined using satellite remote sensing (RS) data and compared with the conventional K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (KG) divisions. Using the nationwide database of hospitalisations among the elderly (≥65 year olds), we examined the utility of a RS-based climate regionalization to assess public health risk due to extreme weather, by comparing the rate of hospitalisations in response to thermal extremes across climatic regions. Satellite image composites from 2002-2012 were aggregated, masked and compiled into a multi-dimensional dataset. The conterminous USA was classified into 8 distinct regions using a stepwise regionalization approach to limit noise and collinearity (LKN), which exhibited a high degree of consistency with the KG regions and a well-defined regional delineation by annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation values. The most populous was a temperate wet region (10.9 million), while the highest rate of hospitalisations due to exposure to heat and cold (9.6 and 17.7 cases per 100,000 persons at risk, respectively) was observed in the relatively warm and humid south-eastern region. RS-based regionalization demonstrates strong potential for assessing the adverse effects of severe weather on human health and for decision support. Its utility in forecasting and mitigating these effects has to be further explored.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {In this research, climate classification maps over the Korean Peninsula at 1 km resolution were generated using the satellite-based climatic variables of monthly temperature and precipitation based on machine learning approaches. Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC).},

Washburn in the late 1950s in the Mesters Vig area, northeast Greenland, are used to derive estimates of long-term mass wasting in the area. Rates of 2.9-8.1 cm.yr-1 are calculated for a 2.5-3° slope and 1.5-30.4 cm.yr-1 for a gelifluction lobe on a 15-23° slope. Compared to Washburn's short-term measurements for the same sites these long-term rates suggest a general increase in the rate of mass wasting in the Mesters Vig area over the last 40 years. This increase may be related to a general pattern of climatic amelioration for the east coast of Greenland. {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

The climatic regionalization was performed predominately objectively with a combination of two statistical methods; the factor analysis which was followed by k-means clustering. With the use of factor analysis the initial number of 31 climate variables was reduced to four variables or factors, which comprised the input for the cluster analysis where Slovenia was divided into six climate regions: Submediterranean climate region, Wet climate of hilly region, Moderate climate of hilly region, Subcontinental climate region, Subalpine climate region and Alpine climate region. Compared to previous climatic regionalization studies for Slovenia, the presented study uses a higher degree of objectivity in the determination of the extent and borders between climate regions. The current study was based purely on climate data, while in the previous studies, the borders were defined more subjectively, based on the authors' expertise of local climate.},

abstract = {The problem of clustering climate data observation sites and grouping them by their climate types is considered. Machine learning–based clustering algorithms are used in analyzing climate data time series from more than 3,000 climate observation sites in the United States, with the objective of classifying climate type for regions across the United States. Understanding the climate type of a region has applications in public health, environment, actuarial science, insurance, agriculture, and engineering. In this study, daily climate data measurements for temperature and precipitation from the time period 1946–2015 have been used. The daily data observations were grouped into three derived data sets: a monthly data set (daily data aggregated by month), an annual data set (daily data aggregated by year), and a threshold exceeding frequency data set (threshold exceeding frequency provides the frequency of occurrence of certain climate extremes). Three existing clustering algorithms from the literature, namely, k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies, were each applied to cluster each of the data sets, and the resulting clusters were assessed using standardized clustering indices. The results from these unsupervised learning techniques revealed the suitability and applicability of these algorithms in the climate domain. The clusters identified by these techniques were also compared with existing climate classification types such as the K{\"{o}}ppen classification system. Additionally, the work also developed an interactive web and map-based data visualization system that uses efficient big data management techniques to provide clustering solutions in real time and to display the results of the clustering analysis.},

abstract = {The concept of time of wetness (TOW) is extensively used in the atmospheric corrosion disciplines for such purposes as corrosion prognostics and environmental corrosivity classification. Time of wetness can generally be defined as the amount of time a metal surface remains wet during atmospheric exposure. Although the basic concept and importance of TOW in governing atmospheric corrosion is generally agreed upon, what is meant by " wet " has generally remained ambiguous and its practical determination has been widely varied throughout its history. The objective of this review is to demystify TOW in terms of definition and measurement and identify issues that inhibit this parameter from providing deeper insight into the effect wetness duration has on atmospheric corrosion. Specifically, this paper summarizes the current state of TOW determination methods along with the parallel concept leaf wetness used in environmental science. Furthermore, wetting and drying phenomena associated with atmospheric corrosion and thought to control TOW are overviewed. From this framework, current issues and limitations of TOW are identified and avenues for further improvement suggested.},

The effects on atmospheric corrosion due to changes in the environmental temperature, carbon dioxide, relative humidity, wind, rainfall and pollution are considered. The limitations and complexities of these assessments are discussed. To demonstrate the use and limitations of this science to evaluate effects related to climate change, a model developed in Australia to predict corrosion is combined with climate change models to project the change in the corrosion rates of steel components and protective zinc coatings in constructions. The method is applied to constructions located along the coastal areas of two Australian cities: Melbourne and Brisbane. These assessments are made using the A1FI scenario, the highest emission scenario defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, applied to nine general circulation models. The projected changes in corrosion rates were found to be an increase of ̃14% for both zinc and steel in Brisbane and a decrease of ̃14% for steel and 9% for zinc in Melbourne. It was also found that the uncertainties associated with the climate change models were small compared to those involved in modelling corrosion for engineering purposes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

Although a considerable number of isolated Earth System features have been analysed with ML techniques, more generic application to understand better the full climate system has not occurred. For instance, ML may aid teleconnection identification, where complex feedbacks make characterisation difficult from direct equation analysis or visualisation of measurements and Earth System model (ESM) diagnostics. Artificial intelligence (AI) can then build on discovered climate connections to provide enhanced warnings of approaching weather features, including extreme events. While ESM development is of paramount importance, we suggest a parallel emphasis on utilising ML and AI to understand and capitalise far more on existing data and simulations.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, a continuous rise in global air temperatures resulted in significant changes in the global hydrological cycle. Regionally increased frequencies of extreme weather events and changes in the regional extent of drylands resulted in new areas at risk of desertification, a complex process driven by socio-economic and climate-related factors. Although desertification is not confined to drylands, they are the most vulnerable to land degradation processes. To investigate possible changes in climate patterns over the past 60years, we couple the information obtained from the K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (KG) climate classification and the FAO aridity index (AI), providing an overview of the most evident global changes in climate regimes from 1951-1980 to 1981-2010 and focussing on the modifications of the extent of drylands. KG and AI indicators have been computed on a 0.5°×0.5° global grid using precipitation data from the Full Data Reanalysis (v6.0) of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration data from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (CRUTSv3.20). Both KG and AI show that the arid areas globally increased between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010, but decreased on average in the Americas. North-Eastern Brazil, Southern Argentina, the Sahel, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Mediterranean area, North-Eastern China and Sub-Himalayan India have been identified as areas with a significant increase of drylands extent. An analysis of the scientific literature gives evidence that most of the areas identified are effectively undergoing desertification, thus confirming the validity of AI and KG to highlight the areas under risk of desertification. We also discuss the global decrease of cold areas, the progressive change from continental to temperate climate in Central Europe, the shift from tundra to continental climate in Alaska, Canada and North-Eastern Russia and the widening of the tropical belt.},

It is a fact that this issue, which is also discussed outside the scientific fields, is not known enough by the society. Evaluation linking climate change to human impact is one of the most important evidence of this lack of information. Those who work in climate studies, especially geographers, know that climate change has anthropogenic causes as well as natural causes. Another issue here is what is changing. So, what is the climate feature and how can we show that there is a change in these features. In this respect, climate types and climate classifications are some important issues. General climate characters can be classified by some methods. Accordingly, climate-related researchers can make evaluations for a country or region based on these classifications. However, climate is a dynamic phenomenon. Consequently, classical climate classification methods now require an update. Although different studies have been carried out on climate classification, we aim to bring a different perspective to the classical climate classification by cluster analysis. Turkey, due to its special location, is a country with many different climate types. The most important reason for having different climate classes is the mathematical location, the effects of air masses and fronts, and a special topography. Classification of Turkey's climate has been under many studies since the 1900 s. In particular, these studies contributed significantly to the scientific sense since the 1950 s.},

Atmospheric corrosion tests were ultimately carried out in order to determine the corrosion resistance of a cement concrete airfield pavement, as well as to assess the type of corrosion and research data in order to determine and estimate the corrosivity of the atmosphere. Atmospheric corrosivity is one of the parameters characterizing the technical condition of airfield pavement functional elements; it makes it possible to estimate a suitable frequency of airfield periodic inspections. Assessments of concrete corrosion and atmospheric corrosivity enable appropriate countermeasures to be taken in order to maintain the airport functional elements in a constant state of technical readiness. In the following study, the prepared samples were exposed to atmospheric conditions in designated places located at selected military airport facilities. Corrosion samples in the form of 50 mm × 100 mm standard samples, 1 mm to 3 mm in thickness, were placed on special frames located within fenced corrosion stations. The corrosion rate rcorr of a specific metal, expressed as a corrosion loss, depends on the environmental conditions.

The K1 values are used to determine the categories of atmospheric corrosivity, and K1 is also the main parameter in models for the prediction of long-term corrosion losses of metals. In the absence of experimental values of K1, their values can be predicted on the basis of meteorological and aerochemical parameters of the atmosphere using the dose-response functions (DRF). Currently, the DRFs presented in ISO 9223:2012(E) /1/ standard are used for predicting K1 in any region of the world, along with the unified DRFs /2/ and the new DRFs /3/. The predicted values of corrosion losses (K1pr) of carbon steel, zinc, copper and aluminum obtained by various DRFs for various continental regions of the world are presented. In this work we used the atmosphere corrosivity parameters and experimental data on the corrosion losses of metals for the first year of exposure (K1exp) for the locations of the tests performed under the international UN/ECE program, the MICAT project, and the Russian program. For the first time, a comparative assessment of the reliability of various DRFs is given by comparing the values of K1pr and K1ex using graphical and statistical methods. The statistical indicators of reliability of predicting the corrosion losses of metals are calculated for various categories of atmosphere corrosivity.

Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.

@article{Zscheischler2012,
abstract = {Classifying the land surface according to different climate zones is often a prerequisite for global diagnostic or predictive modelling studies. Classical classifications such as the prominent K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (KG) approach rely on heuristic decision rules. Although these heuristics may transport some process understanding, such a discretization may appear "arbitrary" from a data oriented perspective. In this contribution we compare the precision of a KG classification to an unsupervised classification (k-means clustering). Generally speaking, we revisit the problem of "climate classification" by investigating the inherent patterns in multiple data streams in a purely data driven way. One question is whether we can reproduce the KG boundaries by exploring different combinations of climate and remotely sensed vegetation variables. In this context we also investigate whether climate and vegetation variables build similar clusters. In terms of statistical performances, k-means clearly outperforms classical climate classifications. However, a subsequent stability analysis only reveals a meaningful number of clusters if both climate and vegetation data are considered in the analysis. This is a setback for the hope to explain vegetation by means of climate alone. Clearly, classification schemes like K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger will play an important role in the future. However, future developments in this area need to be assessed based on data driven approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Dmowska2020,
abstract = {Quantifying and effectively communicating the spatio-racial distribution of urban residencies is important for taking the measure of how the multiracial society organizes itself in an urban environment. Most currently used approaches to this problem center around the calculation of segregation metrics; as such, they pertain to only a single pattern's feature and they lack a compelling visualization component. In this paper, we propose a reimagined approach to spatio-racial analysis based on the concept of landscape and landscape analysis. This approach unites quantification and visualization components of the analysis. It also quantifies the entire racial topography, not just segregation. Key novel concepts are the racial landscape (RL) and the exposure matrix. RL is a high-resolution grid in which each cell contains only inhabitants of a single race. The exposure matrix tabulates adjacencies between neighboring cells weighted by the local density of adjacent subpopulations; it provides a concise quantification of the RL pattern. Two information-theoretical metrics, derived from the exposure matrix, quantify diversity, and segregation of the RL. Segregation is quantified from cell adjacencies without the need for subdivision of the region of interest. Thus, the entire region, as well as its arbitrary subregions, are RLs quantified by their diversities and segregations. Coloring cells in RL according to combinations of their race and local densities provides a natural visualization of racial topography which serves as an “observation” that provides check on numerical metrics. The RL method is described and its application is demonstrated on Cook County, IL. An implementation of the RL method in R package accompanies this paper.},

@article{DelaFuente2011,
abstract = {A great deal of information is available on the atmospheric corrosion of mild steel in the short, mid and even long term, but studies of the structure and morphology of corrosion layers are less abundant and generally deal with those formed in just a few years. The present study assesses the structure and morphology of corrosion product layers formed on mild steel after 13. years of exposure in five Spanish atmospheres of different types: rural, urban, industrial and marine (mild and severe). The corrosion layers have been characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Long-term corrosion is seen to be more severe in the industrial and marine atmospheres, and less so in the rural and urban atmospheres. In all cases the corrosion rate is seen to decrease with exposure time, stabilising after the first 4-6. years of exposure. The most relevant aspects to be noted are (a) the great compaction of the rust layers formed in the rural and urban atmospheres, (b) the formation of hematite and ferrihydrite phases (not commonly found) in the industrial and marine atmospheres, respectively and (c) identification of the typical morphological structures of lepidocrocite (sandy crystals and flowery plates), goethite (cotton balls structures) and akaganeite (cotton balls structures and cigar-shaped crystals). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
